            <p>
                Pokemon Tracker is a completion tracker that keeps track of your progress in all 21 mainline Pokemon games. There are over 1000 Pokemon in all of these games, making it hard for many players to completely fill out each Pokedex. Using this you can track which Pokemon have caught, and where to get news ones. Additionally, you can track which unique items you have collected in each of the games.
